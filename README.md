# Add-on Script for Kodi: script.picture.photo-frame

Slideshow Add-on for Kodi with on-the-fly, user defined image cropping and resizing

An Add-on for the **[Kodi Home Theater 
Software](https://kodi.tv/)** to play a photo slideshow based on 
playlist with on-the-fly image cropping and resizing.

The slideshow can be started selecting the proper Context Menu 
entry over a pictures directory.

Image change is controlled by a timer or via joypad keys. Next 
and previous images are prepared in cache, so that image change 
is almost immediate.

Playlists can be prepared with the
**[photo-reframe-app](https://github.com/RigacciOrg/photo-reframe-app)**.
