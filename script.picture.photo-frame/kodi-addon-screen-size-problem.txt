Cannot use the full xbmcgui.Window with a ControlImage()

I wrote an Addon script featuring a very simple slideshow, where I need
just a ControlImage fitting the entire xbmcgui.Window.

In my first attempt (code below) I read the actual window size and then
create the ControlImage. Surprisingly enough the resulting image is cropped
on the TV: the top-left corner is OK, but the lower-right is out of screen:

class MyClass(xbmcgui.Window):
    def myInit(self):
        w = self.getWidth()
        h = self.getHeight()
        self.image = xbmcgui.ControlImage(0, 0, w, h, "image.jpg")
        self.addControl(self.image)


By trial and error I figured out that the image must be smaller by some
amount:

class MyClass(xbmcgui.Window):
    def myInit(self):
        w = self.getWidth() - 80
        h = self.getHeight() - 48
        self.image = xbmcgui.ControlImage(0, 0, w, h, "image.jpg")
        self.addControl(self.image)

Actually the screen is 1360x768 and the image must be 1280x720 to fit
exactly the entire screen.

Any clue why this odd behaviour?
